Mi devo portare lâ€™ombrello?
Should I bring an umbrella?
You will have to create a new application to check the weather around the world!
Use ReactJS and OPTIONALLY Redux (what you've learned so far).

Functionality
The user must be able to select the city and receive information on the weather (will it rain?, temperature?, next days?)
You can use the Open Weather API to build your own Weather site!
https://openweathermap.org/api
Think about the interface, the components you need and start creating the best weather app possible!
